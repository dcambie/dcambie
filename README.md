Open-source software is somewhat akin to academic research in the way several skilled people contribute to publish a piece of work.

Too often, however, academic code is either closed sourced or "_available upon [reasonable] request_". I find statements like that unethical: they are a direct insult towards the reproducibility of science, the agency funding the work, the FAIR data movement and the scientific community as a whole.

I pledge to release publicly all the raw data and source code associated with all the publications generated in my research group.

<!--
Consider add something more on Python vs. LabView, collaboration on shared open source library for flow equipment. But maybe less is more :)
