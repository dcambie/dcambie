Open-source software is somewhat akin to academic research: several skilled people contributing to publish a piece of work.

Far too often, however, academic code is either closed sourced or "_available upon [reasonable] request_". I find statements like this deeply unethical. They are a direct insult towards the reproducibility of science, to the agency funding the work, to the FAIR data movement and to the scientific community as a whole.

I pledge to release publicly all the raw data and source code associated with all the publications generated in my research group. And you should do the same.

<!--
Consider add something more on Python vs. LabView, collaboration on shared open source library for flow equipment. But maybe less is more :)
