Far too often academic code is either closed sourced or "_available upon [reasonable] request_".

I find statements like this in contrast with the mission of academic research to further human knowledge. Such attitude hinders reproducibility and negatively affect the scientific community as a whole.


I truly believe in open science, therefore I pledge to:
 * release publicly the raw data and source code associated with the publications generated in my research group _in a reusable format_ unless legally prevented to do so by NDA or other IP agreements.
 * support open-access in a pragmatic way, e.g. publishing preprints for manuscripts submitted to non open-access journals.

The effects of the digital transformation on academic research are evident in the digitization of scholarly journals and the simplification of international collaborations.

However, code sharing is limited, raw data almost non existing despite funding agency mandating data management plans and reproducibility is already affected by increasing complexity of contemporary research.

Consider add something more on Python vs. LabView, collaboration on shared open source library for flow equipment. But maybe less is more :)
